<h3>DEPED MANDATE</h3>
<p>
    The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree of 1863<br> as the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction under a Chairman.
    The Education agency underwent many reorganization<br> efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose<br> vis a vis the changing administrations and charters.<br>
     The present day Department of Education was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155,<br> otherwise known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 2001 <br>
     which establishes the mandate of this agency.<br>
<br>
    The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements, and coordinates policies, plans,<br> programs and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal basic education. <br>
    It supervises all elementary and secondary education institutions, including alternative learning systems,<br> both public and private; 
     and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a<br> complete, adequate, and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national development.
